        <h1>HOW TO GET STARTED?</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Welcome to the underworld, I hope you enjoy your stay. Gaming can be a very rewarding hobby, but you need to be careful that you're only playing in moderation! (I may be a little bit of a hypocrite for saying that, but it's important to remember nonetheless.) And don't forget the most important rule: have fun!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Choosing a Gaming Platform</h2>
        <p>
            The first step in your gaming journey is to choose the right platform. There are several options to choose from, including consoles, PC, and mobile devices. Each platform has its own advantages and unique gaming experiences, so make sure you choose one that works for you!
        </p>

        <h2>Finding Games That Are Right For You</h2>
        <p>
            Once you've chosen a platform, it's time to find games that interest you! There are many genres to explore, such as action, adventure, simulation, puzzle, horror, RPG, shooter, and more. If you have friends who game already, you could start by asking what they recommend and go from there.
        </p>

        <h2>FTP or PTW?</h2>
        <p>
            Before you spend money buying games, make sure you've done your research on what the game is about. There are plenty of people who are F2P (free-to-play) gamers, who haven't spent any money on games and still have a fun time. There are so many free games available, for example Valorant (shooter game), Roblox (online multiplayer), and most games on sites with independent game developers, such as itch.io. But if you are a PTW (pay-to-win) style player, make sure you know the game is worth the cost!
        </p>

        <h2>Learning the Controls</h2>
        <p>
            Familiarize yourself with the controls of your chosen platform. Each game may have unique controls, so take some time to learn them. Most games offer tutorials or practice modes to help you get started, and many even have similar controls to each other (especially for PC games) in order to reduce difficulty in remembering keybinds.
        </p>

        <h2>Joining the Community</h2>
        <p>
            Gaming is more fun when shared with others. Join online communities, forums, or social media groups to connect with fellow gamers. You can find tips, discuss games, and even make new friends if you're lucky! Simultaneously, make sure to keep yourself safe when playing games with others you haven't met in real life. Sometimes, you'll meet toxic players, who make the games a lot less fun. If this happens, don't be afraid to mute or block them. After all, hobbies are meant to be enjoyable!
