        <h1>WHY DO I GAME?</h1>
        <p class="bio">
            Hey, I'm Fenn. Welcome to my website! I've always been passionate about gaming, and it's one of my goals in life to someday create my own fully-fledged video game. I especially like horror games and visual novels. That's why for this project I wanted to focus on fun interactivity within the website - the goal being to inspire more people to play (or make) small games like this!<br>
            <br>
            You might be wondering WHY I love games so much, and WHY I think gaming is a hobby meant for everyone. I think the appeal of most video games is the interactive aspect - you get to feel like you're a part of a wider story, while also being whisked away from your regular life struggles. It's no coincidence that visual novels - which combine the storytelling elements of books and the decision-making of games - are so popular nowadays. You get the best of both worlds: a story you've never heard with an ending you have control over. They're also incredibly easy for people with little gaming experience to become immersed in, unlike other games which require previous gaming knowledge to get into the swing of (e.g. WASD being common keybinds for movement). <br>
            <br>
            As for horror games, there's a wide variety of styles that this genre of gaming covers. Whether the game be disturbing, loud, slightly creepy, or straight-up horrifying, they do have something in common. The scenarios create a sense of escapism within the player. Their adrenaline pumps while being exposed to vast scenes of terrors, and they forget about their mundane, daily worries for a bit. Sometimes, horror games can help put things into perspective; your worries are only as bad as the situations that you compare them to.
